# Base Transformer
Number base transformer - (all possibilities)

This is a project that will work with translation of numerical bases, and all transformations will be possible:
## Especial operations.
  ## Binary base:
    Binary to octal;       
    Binary to decimal;               
    Binary to hexadecimal.              
  
  ## Octal base:
    Octal to binary;                          
    Octal to decimal;         
    Octal to hexadecimal.        
  
  ## Decimal base:
    Decimal to binary;        
    Decimal to octal;      
    Decimal to hexadecimal.      
 
  ## Hexadecimal base:
    Hex to binary;         
    Hex to octal;        
    Hex to decimal.       
  
## Operation
 The operation is done by sending the numbers to the translator function to decimal, saving the result in a variable, then sending this variable to the respective translator function.
 Ex: 4EF - HEX -> ? BIN       
     4EF -> DEC       
     DEC -> DecToBin      
     DecToBin = 10011101111      
     
## The code is still under construction and if you want to contribute just make a fork, when ready, just make a pull request. :)
